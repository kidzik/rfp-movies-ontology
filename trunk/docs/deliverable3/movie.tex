We decided to build our ontology on Protégé user interface. For this, we used as reference the Movie Ontology \cite{movieontology} (CREATE REFERENCE TO : http://www.movieontology.org/). We implemented it using our vocabulary created on Collibra and reusing as many entities and properties as possible that appear on \cite{movieontology}, linking our data to theirs. The Movie Ontology, in turn, uses DBPedia \cite{dbpedia} (REFERENCE http://http://dbpedia.org/) for representing entities like \textbf{Language} and \textbf{Person}, moreover, it uses the W3C (Word Wide Web Consortium) \cite{w3c} (REFERENCE http://www.w3.org/) for the \textbf{date} datatype.
