We decided to build our ontology with the Protégé user interface. For this, we used the Movie Ontology as reference 
\cite{movieontology}. We implemented it using our vocabulary created with Collibra and reusing as many entities and 
properties as possible that appear on \cite{movieontology}, linking our data to theirs. The Movie Ontology, in turn, 
uses DBPedia \cite{dbpedia} for representing entities like \textbf{Language} and \textbf{Person}, moreover, it uses 
the W3C (Word Wide Web Consortium) \cite{w3c} for the \textbf{date} datatype.
