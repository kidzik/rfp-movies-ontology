\subsection{SPARQL Queries}
Some examples presented in Section 1 describe how an application would access the concepts defined into the movie ontology.
Therefore, SPARQL queries are implemented in order to make a demonstration of how these examples previously proposed work in practice.

Jena API was used to code in Java a routine composed by the following steps:

\begin{itemize}
  \item Load the model from an .owl file to create an instance of OntModel
\begin{lstlisting}
OntModel model = ModelFactory.createOntologyModel(OntModelSpec.OWL_DL_MEM_RDFS_INF);
// use the class loader to find the input file
InputStream in = FileManager.get().open(inputOWLFileName);
// read the RDF/XML/OWL file
model.read(new InputStreamReader(in), "");
\end{lstlisting}

  \item Write strings that are queries in SPARQL and submit them to QueryExecutionFactory
\begin{lstlisting}
String query2 = "SELECT ?p ?o WHERE {?p <http://www.movieontology.org/2009/10/01/movieontology.owl#title> ?o.}";
\end{lstlisting}

  \item Collect the results from in a ResultSet.
\begin{lstlisting}
1 http://localhost/WTFDL/movie_ontology.owl#Way_of_the_Dragon Way of the Dragon 
2 http://localhost/WTFDL/movie_ontology.owl#The_Mask  The Mask  
3 http://localhost/WTFDL/movie_ontology.owl#Inception Inception 
4 http://localhost/WTFDL/movie_ontology.owl#Ace_Ventura Ace Ventura, Pet Detective  
\end{lstlisting}

\end{itemize}

Futhermore, some other queries listed below were implemented:

\begin{itemize}
 \item Get movies whose title contains ``the''.
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Query : 
\begin{verbatim}
SELECT ?p ?genre WHERE {
  ?p <http://www.movieontology.org/2009/10/01/movieontology.owl#title> ?o.
  FILTER regex(?o, "the", "i")
}
\end{verbatim}
    \item
      \begin{lstlisting}
1 http://localhost/WTFDL/movie_ontology.owl#Way_of_the_Dragon 
2 http://localhost/WTFDL/movie_ontology.owl#The_Mask  
      \end{lstlisting}
    \end{itemize}

\end{itemize}
